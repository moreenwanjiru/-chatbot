In this project, I'm using `comet_llm` to keep track of what users ask, how the bot responds, and how long each interaction takes. The information is logged to this [comet project](https://www.comet.com/yennhi95zz/ecom-shopbot-openai). This helps in improving the model for future training. You can learn more about experiment tracking with [Comet LLM](https://github.com/comet-ml/comet-llm).
